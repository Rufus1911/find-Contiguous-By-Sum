# find-Contiguous-By-Sum

This code, when provided an int array and int sum, will find a contiguous subarray within the array that is equal to the sum.

If there is no such subarray within the array provided, the code will return an array equal in size to the provided array that contains all 0s.

The current driver can be edited for your own testing purposes, either by changing the array size/values or by changing the value of the sum.
